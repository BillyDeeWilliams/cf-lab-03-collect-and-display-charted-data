#Lab 3 User Stories

Marketing Research Team:

  we want to collect relevant data.
  we want to evaluate the popularity of our products and determine which are most desirable.
  we want to show the focus group a selection of three products and ask which is most appealing.
  we will keep track of not only how many times each product was selected, but also the number of times which is was displayed so we can compare the two.
  we will present three products at a time.
  no two subsequent selections presented will contain the same pictures. (each set of three products will be different from the previous three)


Focus Group Participant:

  I will choose from a selection of three products, which I am most likely to buy.
  I have been told to expect each set of three will be different, and I will try to treat each set independently.
  I need an app that is easy and straight forward.
  I need easy clear, idiot proof instructions
  I may need motivation to complete the survey
  I would like an engaging and fun experience

Developer (me):

  I will keep in mind the needs of the researchers and the experience of the focus group participants.
  I will break the problem down into smaller solvable problems and create an algorithm to solve each problem.
  I will turn each algorithm into pseudo code and address each smaller problem in turn
  I will save and test frequently
  I will use console.log to help debug as I develop
  I will create clear, informative comments in my code from the pseudo code I developed first.
  I will use descriptive variable names
  I will keep clean, legible code that maintains consistent style formatting.
  I will meet all the requirement/ needs of the researchers and the focus group
